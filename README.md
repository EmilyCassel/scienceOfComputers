## Description
A regex about hexadecimal matching

## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development was to learn more about hexadecimal matching. When I first looked at the name on the assignment I couldnâ€™t remember what it was. But once I researched it, I remmebered. I hope my work will help someone else remember what it is and how to use it. 

## User Story
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines

## Technologies Used: 
This assignment uses html and gist


## Challenges 
Remembering what hexadecimal matching is. 


## Successes
Realizing that hexadecimal matching is related to the colors. Also remembering a lot of the names for different things and finding out what the ? represented 


## Directions for Future Development
I think more examples would be helpful but in a format that does not overwhelm the reader
