# Matching a Hex Value




## Summary

This Regex Tutorial is about Matching a Hex Value. A Hex Value is short for a hexadecimal value, a number displayed in the hexadecimal system. This system uses 16 symbols to represent number values. They are A-F or a-f for the last 6 values which are numbers 10-15. Numbers 0-9 represent the first 10. In the hexadecimal system each number place represents to the 16th power and each decimal to the tenth. An example is that 3A would be 3 to the 16th = 48 + A which would be 10 to the 16th = 160 giving 208

[\dA-Fa-f]?

## Regex Components

### Anchors
In hexadecimals there is no standardized anchor but they are used to destinguish patterns in code. One example would be that ("^") would display the start of the data

### Quantifiers
In hexadecimals quantifiers use the hexadecimal characters of 0-9 and A-F(a-f) not on a string. 


### OR Operator
In hexadecimals OR Operators are used to connect ranges and patterns of hexadecimal digits.
